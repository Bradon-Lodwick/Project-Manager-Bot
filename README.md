# Project Management Bot
A bot made to aid in running multiple projects within a single discord server.

# Install
To install the bot, simply clone this repository (use the master branch for the most stable and recent version) and
follow the setup instructions below.

# Setup
Before running the bot, changes must be made to the example_settings.py file. The instructions for the needed changes
are in the file itself.  You will need to create a discord bot through the development portal on discord's site
(https://discordapp.com/developers) and retrieve the bot's token to put into the example_settings.py file.
